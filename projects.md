### Puppet Enterprise

**I helped** as a software engineer on a Full Stack team of developers. We used Ember.js, Typescript, and Clojure. My team's focus was improving the time to value for our new customers, making navigation more intuitive, and maintaining and implementing accessibility standards to all parts of the application. I also had an opportunity to be Scrum Master for my team, as well as demo some of our recent improvements to the console to the company internally and on our community slack.

### Puppet

**I helped** develop solutions to bugs and feature requests for this product in Ruby, alongside a team of platform developers. I acted as the team's Agile Team Lead, coordinated with our Project Owner and Product Managers to make sure the team had work ready for them and had help they needed from adjacent teams.

### Puppet Documentation
