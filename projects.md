**I helped** as a software engineer on a Full Stack team of developers. We used Ember.js, Typescript, and Clojure. My team's focus was improving the time to value for new customers, making navigation more intuitive, and maintaining and implementing accessibility standards to all parts of the application. I also acted as Scrum Master for my team, as well as demoed some of our recent improvements to the console internally to the company and to customers on the community slack.

### Puppet

**I helped** develop solutions to bugs and feature requests for this product in Ruby, as part of a team of platform developers. I acted as the team's Agile Team Lead, coordinated with our Project Owner and Product Managers to make sure the team had work ready for them and had help they needed from adjacent teams.

### Puppet Documentation
